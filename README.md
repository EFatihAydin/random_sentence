	* In this project, we aim to create a model with the proper data.txt file we want to feed and to investigate whether the text entered on the keyboard is meaningful or meaningless.

# Methods

	* creator_probobility_matrix.py -> create matrix model script
	* creator_random_texts.py -> create random sentence with random words script
	* control_input_value.py -> try with input script
	* clean -> clean text by turkish words
	* trinity -> parse line into three characters

# Usage information:

	1) When your data.txt file is ready, we create a model by running creator_probobility_matrix.py
	2) We test the model with input_control.py according to  user input from keyboard
